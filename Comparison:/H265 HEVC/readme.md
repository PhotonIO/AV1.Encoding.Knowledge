It can do video playback at 10-bit actual desktop bit depth is 8-bit. It's not worth the aggravation even though the video quality is better. I care more about standard usage across image details across all programs than I do just video playback. I don't feel like switch display outputs or going multi-display either it's a unneeded nuisance. The iGPU itself is actually moderately reasonable though. It's not great, but for integrate I'm still pleasantly surprised at how capable modern iGPU's have gotten. Intel's encoder quality is clean and crisp."
